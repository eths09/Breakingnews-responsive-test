          eff Bezos can have anything. He could circle the globe in a private jet or sail it forever in a <br/> 
          fleet of megayachts. He could afford to buy a the whole NFL; he could buy an archipelago for his <br/>
          family and friends; he could buy over 65,000 Bugatti Chirons (base price $2.9 million), even though <br/>
          only 500 are being built. As the world's richest person, the possibilities are endless. But Bezos <br/>
          appears ready to risk it all for an 11-minute ride to space.
